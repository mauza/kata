hey my name is on the left. Cool <---

Anyways here's what you need to do

Find out netgear admin/pass
find out atran admin/pass
turn of DHCP on comcast and atran
and then make sure this is your setup

INTERNET -> Comcast -> Netgear -> Atran
			(phone?)   Wireless   Ethernet

If you wanted them separate, there's ways, but not with 3 DHCP

Yes, Atran goes into netgear and comcast goes into netgear
Okay
so here's the problem if you need to explain it, besides the obvious :)

Then you set static on the pi
or just tell the DHCP server in netgear to use static IP
I do that, it's easier and I can adjust it faster (remotely)

Then people can go there. Last thing. Hostnames. In your static config, you should set a host name so you can type
192.168.0.100 or pi-project
It will take you to either
since .coms and .nets aren't real on private networks. Technically you could, but it's not what people think or easy?

NO - I don't know Atran
never hear of it
could be some shady chinese company for all I know
You could have a far better network for under $100
It's easily managed and has amazing throughput. But that's besides the point. Oh right. You never let switches do DHCP.
second hand? it is a startup so I get that
but don't cheap out on network stuff

yea sure
Okay so
best practice is to have router or domain do DHCP
Your comcast business class router is a modem/router
Since you don't have a domain, I'd go with netgear
Also update it while you are in there, it plugs security holes
but ya you might need to do something else
your router could be set static at 192.168.1.1 which we know it is but since comcast is in router mode issuing DHCP, your netgear could decide to pull a 10.1.10.2 address and then you'd have a problem, so you can fix that by turning it off.

I wish i could show you my setup so it'd make sense
but it's basically what i mapped above except my access points (yes i have multiple) are connected to POE switch via Ethernet and get DHCP from domain
This allows me to track them and do DPI (deep packet inspection) and see what they are doing. Lots of facebook and youtube.

Domain controller
usually
company.local
so you have computers called this with host names
casey.company.local -> 192.168.1.16
server.company.local -> 192.168.1.1
but you don't use 192 in business, you would use an instance of 10.x
Yes, 172, 168, and 10 are the private IP sectors
10.1.1.x is 253 addresses
10.1.x.x is like thousands
10.x is millions
you control that by subnets
255.255.255.0 means 255 hosts
255.255.0.0 means 255 * 255
255.255.255.132 means like 100 i don't remember math but you get my point

So I'm on 10.1.10.x / 255.255.0.0
because I have like 200 devices on my network at one time (busiest time of year, but that's what you budget for)

wow I wrote a novel. Too bad I didn't have to do a thesis for my degree. But i do have to design a 200 user, 4 building network and phone system.
I'l like, LOL ez, but my degree is inflated with saudi arabia students and their english
not so good
phone....
